## Acceptance Criteria

```
Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

```

## Guidelines

- Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to MySQL database and perform queries.

- Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

- Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. A cleaner version of the built in `console.table();`
